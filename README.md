# React Native Rick and Morty API Project

This project is a learning exercise designed to showcase basic skills in React Native. It uses the Rick and Morty API to fetch and display character data, demonstrating the use of Axios for API requests, FlatList for rendering lists, and handling infinite scrolling.

## Features

- Fetch character data from the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character).
